# Neural-Network-Learning-Rules
## The basic learning rules in Neural Networks
1. Hebbian Learning Rule : It identifies, how to modify the weights of nodes of a network.
2. Perceptron Learning Rule: Network starts its learning by assigning a random value to each weight.
3. Delta Learning Rule: Modification in sympatric weight of a node is equal to the multiplication of error and the input.
4. Correlation Learning Rule: The correlation rule is the supervised learning.
5. Out-Star Learning Rule: We can use it when it assumes that nodes or neurons in a network arranged in a layer.
